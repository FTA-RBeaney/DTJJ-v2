Original idea,"London used to have internationally known Lindy Hop festivals before the pandemic. A combination of Covid, Black Lives Matter and a generational change of dancers has kept the London community more dispersed into smaller micro communities. This festival is organised by a variety of London teachers and organisers with a range of experience of managing a variety of scale events. This event is a reflection of what we have admired at other events and what we would like to see in our own city.",Trisha- please can you sense check - we want to acknowledge the London community was not perfect to begin with,"London once hosted internationally recognised Lindy Hop festivals, but the scene changed after the pandemic. COVID, the impact of Black Lives Matter, and a generational shift among dancers have fragmented the London scene into smaller micro-communities. This festival brings together a collective of London teachers and organisers, each with varied experiences in running events. It reflects what we have admired at other gatherings and what we aim to foster in our own city.

The UK has always been at the forefront of the new wave of Lindy Hoppers, especially since Mama Lu and her Parkettes came to the UK in the early 80s, planting a seed that inspired dancers to grow, share, and celebrate this tradition. That moment was pivotal in recognising the significance of Lindy Hop within the broader history of Black dance in Britain.

The message we aim to share is to recognise the UK’s role in the history and development of Lindy Hop, and honour the ongoing creations of our community. This festival is both a return to roots and a step forward.
","London is a hub for the global arts: a host for internationally recognised festivals.  The UK’s capital city reflects (OR ONCE REFLECTED) these qualities in the London Lindy Hop scene.  
The UK has always been at the forefront of the new wave of Lindy Hoppers, especially since Mama Lu and her Parkettes came to the UK in the mid 80s and Frankie Manning a few years later, planting a seed that inspired dancers to grow, share, and celebrate the tradition of Lindy Hop and Vernacular Jazz Dance. This moment was pivotal in recognising the significance of Lindy Hop within the broader history of Black dance in Britain.
In the aftermath of the pandemic and with the impact of the Black Lives Matter movement, in London, the 30 plus year old UK Lindy Hop scene, which started off relatively underground saw a boom 20 years later, then experienced a generational (OR general) shift among dancers back into smaller micro-communities

Our Vision,"With a variety of experiences between us we wanted to create an event that was more anchored in the values of community, accessibilty of knowlege, and celebration of the different facets of the Black art form we participate in.

Acknowledgement,"Lindy Hop has always been a Black American dance, and created communities in a time of segregation. Black art culture is rooted in joy, embodiment, sharing, and being present. With this event we aim to move away from the Eurocentric perspective/culture imprinted on the community of expected progression, achievement, monetisation and 'fame'.",<needs more work? Should we have community in there? Rooted in joy the appropriate word?,"Lindy Hop is, at its core, a Black American dance, born in a time of segregation and yet powerful enough to create community, resilience, and joy. Black cultural expression has always been rooted in embodiment, sharing, presence, and the celebration of life in all its complexity.
With this event, we aim to honour those roots by moving away from Eurocentric frameworks that emphasise linear progress, achievement, monetisation, or individual fame. Instead, we strive to centre values of community, connection, and creativity.
Black art is expansive and profound; it holds the full range of human emotion, from joy to struggle, and it teaches us that dance is not only performance but also lived experience, memory, and expression.

Black Voices & Anti Racism,"Lindy Hop grew despite of racism in all its forms, and oppression. Over time, Black dancers have been squeezed out by false historical narratives and the centring of white 'expertise'. The London community has some incredible Black dancers and still the overall community is majority white-passing. This organising team is also majority white-passing, and so has sought out Black British community leaders for paid consultation to ensure the Black experience is not erased and that we are not being thoughtless despite well intentioned. ",< might be too spicy? is this too self centring?,"Lindy Hop developed and prospered despite racism and oppression. However, over time, false historical accounts and the dominance of white perspectives have often pushed Black dancers to the edges of their own art form. Today in London, while some exceptional Black dancers exist, the wider community remains mainly white-passing. As organisers, we recognise that we are also mostly white-passing, and with that responsibility comes a duty to act thoughtfully. We have therefore consulted experienced Black British teachers to ensure that their experiences are respected, represented, and not ignored.

Diversity & Inclusion,"Lindy Hop is a partnered dance, and often the gateway to solo jazz classes. By centring solo learning at this event, we hope attendees also see the benefits of this in their partnered dance enjoyments and movement confidence. Solo learning also helps remove the stress for primary follows who have historically spent more time on waiting lists for large events, when organisers attempt role balancing in classes. Relatedly, all partnered classes will be taught as ELEF (everybody leads, everybody follows), to help normalise what a lot of us alredy know; the dance roles have no gender. Aditionally, by removing the expectation of perfectionism in classes by maing them open level, we hope many attendees feel safer in learning about their own movement and the joy that comes with understanding your dance voice.",,"I disagree with the first sentence, so I suggest we position solo as the core and foundation before the LH. 
At its core, Lindy Hop is based on solo movement. Before connecting with a partner, we first connect with our own bodies, rhythms, and expression. That’s why this event focuses on solo learning: by building confidence in your own movement, you not only enhance your enjoyment of solo jazz but also introduce greater freedom, clarity, and creativity into partnered dancing. Solo practice also helps address a longstanding challenge within the scene. Primary followers often face longer waiting lists at major events when organisers attempt to balance roles. By starting with individual movement, we lessen that pressure and give everyone an equal opportunity to learn and develop. When we come together for partnered classes, they will be taught using the ELEF (everybody leads, everybody follows) approach, reflecting what many of us already understand, that dance roles are not linked to gender. By making all classes open level, we eliminate the expectation of perfection, creating a safer space for dancers to explore their own movement, discover their voice, and share in the joy of dance.","Historically classes were always solo and partnered (mixed dance media), its been developed like that & monatised.

Historically, classes were typically solo as well as partnered. The cultural shift towards partnered dancing has become the new norm and monetised as such.

Freedom From Ego,"This event is not about levels, and the deliberate choice for classes to be open/all levels will prevent the heirarchies often created by levelled tracks. We hope participants honour the roots and spirit of the dance and not judge one another on what they believe they know about skill or levels. We are all here to learn something new, and it will look different to all of us. Unsolicited feedback is not welcomed, hyping up your fellow dancer is! If you are craving more of a challenge it is up to you to ask your teacher.",<may be a bit vague,"At this event, we’re moving away from the idea of levels. Instead, we’re offering ‘pathways’ for dancers to explore what they most want to learn, in ways that feel right for them. By keeping everything open level, we avoid the hierarchies that levelled tracks can create and invite everyone to discover something new at their own pace. We encourage participants to honour the roots and spirit of the dance by focusing on shared joy rather than judging each other’s skills or experience. Learning will look different for each of us, and that’s part of the richness. Supportive energy is always welcome. Cheer each other on, celebrate each other’s breakthroughs, and share the dance floor with generosity. If you feel ready for more of a challenge, you’re encouraged to ask your teacher for guidance on how to stretch yourself further.","Concern - its all happy, but it was competitive back in the day","At this event, we’re moving away from the idea of levels.

Yes, things were also competitive back in the day, yet that competitiveness now has become unhealthy in some of its manifestations.
