    content: [
      "London is a hub for the global arts: a host for internationally recognised festivals, though not of late for the London Lindy Hop scene.",
      "The UK has always been at the forefront of the new wave of Lindy Hoppers, especially since Mama Lu and her Parkettes came to the UK in the mid 80s and Frankie Manning a few years later, planting a seed that inspired dancers to grow, share, and celebrate the tradition of Lindy Hop and Vernacular Jazz Dance. This moment was pivotal in recognising the significance of Lindy Hop within the broader history of Black dance in Britain as it had been relatively underground.",
      "In the aftermath of the pandemic and with the impact of the Black Lives Matter movement, in London, the 30 plus year old UK Lindy Hop scene, already in a generational shift also experienced a general shift among dancers back into smaller micro-communities.",
      "This festival team brings together a collective of London teachers and organisers, each with varied experiences in running events.  Our aim is to share the UK's role in the history and development of Lindy Hop worldwide, and to honour the ongoing creations of our communities.",
      "This festival reflects what we have admired at other gatherings and what we aim to foster in our own city. It is both a return to roots and a step forward.",

    title: "Our Vision",
    content: [
      "With a variety of experiences between us we wanted to create an event that was more anchored in the values of community, accessibilty of knowlege, and celebration of the different facets of the Black art form we participate in. We want to work with artists near and far, and are prioritising participation and passion over perfection and posturing. We celebrate local talent in a global community.",

    title: "Acknowledgement",
    content: [
      "Lindy Hop is, at its core, a Black American dance, born in a time of segregation and yet powerful enough to create community, resilience, and joy. Black cultural expression has always been rooted in embodiment, sharing, presence, and the celebration of life in all its complexity.",
      "With this event, we aim to honour those roots by moving away from Eurocentric frameworks that emphasise linear progress, achievement, monetisation, or individual fame. Instead, we strive to centre values of community, connection, and creativity.",
      "Black art is expansive and profound; it holds the full range of human emotion, from joy to struggle, and it teaches us that dance is not only performance but also lived experience, memory, and expression.",
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "Black Voices & Anti Racism",
    content: [
      "Lindy Hop developed and prospered despite racism and oppression.",
      "However, over time, false historical accounts and the dominance of white perspectives have often pushed Black dancers to the edges of their own art form.",
      "Today in London, while some exceptional Black dancers exist, the wider community remains mainly white-passing. As organisers, we recognise that we are also mostly white-passing, and with that responsibility comes a duty to act thoughtfully. We have therefore consulted experienced Black British teachers to ensure that their experiences are respected, represented, and not ignored.",

    title: "Diversity & Inclusion",
    content: [
      "At its core, Lindy Hop is based on solo movement. Before connecting with a partner, we first connect with our own bodies, rhythms, and expression. That’s why this event focuses on solo learning: by building confidence in your own movement, you not only enhance your enjoyment of solo jazz but also introduce greater freedom, clarity, and creativity into partnered dancing.",
      "Historically, classes were typically solo as well as partnered. The cultural shift towards partnered dancing has become the new norm and monetised as such.",
      "Focusing on solo practice also helps address a longstanding challenge within our scene. Primary followers often face longer waiting lists at major events when organisers attempt to balance roles. By starting with individual movement, we lessen that pressure and give everyone an equal opportunity to learn and develop. When we come together for partnered classes, they will be taught using the ELEF (everybody leads, everybody follows) approach, reflecting what many of us already understand, that dance roles are not linked to gender.",
      "By making all classes open level, we eliminate the expectation of perfection, creating a safer space for dancers to explore their own movement, discover their voice, and share in the joy of dance.",

  {
    title: "Freedom From Ego",
    content: [
      "At this event, we’re moving away from the idea of levels. Instead, we’re offering ‘pathways’ for dancers to explore what they most want to learn, in ways that feel right for them. By keeping everything open level, we avoid the hierarchies that levelled tracks can create and invite everyone to discover something new at their own pace.",
      "Yes, things were also competitive back in the day, yet that competitiveness now has become unhealthy in some of its manifestations.",
      "We encourage participants to honour the roots and spirit of the dance by focusing on shared joy rather than judging each other’s skills or experience. Learning will look different for each of us, and that’s part of the richness. Supportive energy is always welcome. Cheer each other on, celebrate each other’s breakthroughs, and share the dance floor with generosity. If you feel ready for more of a challenge, you’re encouraged to ask your teacher for guidance on how to stretch yourself further.",

    title: "Cultural Awareness",
    content: [
      "We aim to celebrate Black culture and expression within the UK. We’ll be joined by British tradition bearers and teachers who will share their experiences of being part of the UK dance scene and reflect on how it has developed over time. Together, we’ll honour the resilience, creativity, and contributions that continue to shape our scene and inspire future generations.",

    title: "Top Line Code of Conduct",
    content: [
      "We want this event to be a safe and joyful space for everyone. That means leaving egos at the door and treating each other with respect and kindness. Racism, transphobia, homophobia, xenophobia, fatphobia, body shaming, ableism, any discrimination or making someone feel shit to make yourself feel better will not be tolerated.",
      "We ask everyone to recognise their privilege, not as the hardships they’ve faced, but as the barriers they haven’t had to experience. It doesn't matter how long you've been dancing or how many competitions you've made finals in - please leave your ego at the door.",
      "You’ll see gender neutral toilets and a variety of pronouns in use; we ask that you respect this as part of ensuring an inclusive environment.",
      "If these values don’t align with you, then this may not be the event for you. But if they do, welcome, this is your jam, and we can’t wait to see you soon!",
